# Product Brief

## Mission

To create a comprehensive, open-source framework for evaluating the robustness and safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) against common failure modes.

## Problem

Developers lack standardized tools to systematically test LLMs for vulnerabilities like prompt injection, factual contradictions, and other adversarial attacks. This makes it difficult to build reliable and safe AI applications.

## MVP Features

*   A modular framework for defining new test suites.
*   A core set of built-in test suites for common failure modes (e.g., injection, contradictions).
*   A runner to execute test suites against specified LLM APIs.
*   A scoring and classification system to evaluate LLM responses.
*   A reporting mechanism to summarize evaluation results.

## Success Criteria

*   The framework is adopted by at least 10 developers within the first three months.
*   The framework is used to identify at least one previously unknown vulnerability in a major open-source LLM.
*   The project receives at least 5 external contributions (e.g., new test suites, bug fixes).
